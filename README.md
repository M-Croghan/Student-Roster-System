# Student-Roster-System

This small project is based on a scenario where I'm responsible for helping a university / educational institution update their 
system to be able to manipulate student data. It's current system (written in C++) is already operational and its 
up to me to implement changes based on the constraints.

Sample student data is provided in CSV format. The data is parsed, student objects are created, and several functions are called
to demonstrate the various operations that can be performed.
