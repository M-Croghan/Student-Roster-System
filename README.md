##  :card_file_box: INTRODUCTION

Within software engineering, there will come a time where it will be necessary to fix issues, add new
enhancements, or migrate existing applications to a new platform using new technologies or programming
languages.  

This small project is based on a scenario where I'm responsible for helping a university / educational
institution update their system to be able to manipulate student data. It's current system (written in C++) is
already operational and its up to me to implement changes based on the constraints.  

The overall idea behind tackling this assignment was to prepare for the inevitable need to adapt and learn new
skills to accomplish a task based on the business requirements, design document, and provided requirements of 
a project.

## :computer: TECHNOLOGIES

* C++
* Visual Studio 2019

## :page_with_curl: SCOPE OF FUNCTIONALITIES

The application incorperates the use of object-oriented programming concepts, arrays, control structures
, functions, pointers, and memory management to solve complex problems. It allows one to:  
    
* Generate & print a student roster based on currently enrolled students.
    * Filter students by degree program.
* Add / remove students to the roster.
* Filter students who have an invalid e-mail addresses.
    

## :bulb: LESSONS LEARNED
This project included many firsts:
- First time planning out an object oriented approach to solving a problem.
- First time using C++.

Two of the biggest take aways were getting comfortable with and using pointers, and getting a better appreciation
for how garbage collection is handled automatically in other programming languages. While the scale of the 
application in its current form isn't large enough for memory issues to arise, it was an illuminating experience 
that made me more mindful of how memory is allocated and the importance of managing it effectively when it is the
engineer's responsibility to do so.
